3D animation with JavaScript

The pageX read-only property of the MouseEvent interface returns the X (horizontal) coordinate (in pixels) 

at which the mouse was clicked, relative to the left edge of the entire document. 

This includes any portion of the document not currently visible.

Very simple and awesome project !
